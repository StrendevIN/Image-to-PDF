- Specify the full path for your image and PDF files:
  - Example for image path:
    ```python
    img = "C:\\Users\\Strendev\\Strendev.png"
    ```
  - Example for PDF output path:
    ```python
    pdf = "C:\\Users\\Strendev\\Strendev.pdf"
    ```
  - Use double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths to avoid errors.

- You can name your PDF file anything you like (e.g., `username.pdf`).
